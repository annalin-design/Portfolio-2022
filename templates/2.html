  <p>The AZ Awards is an annual awards gala in Toronto that celebrates international architecture and design. The art department was tasked to create a promotional video that explains what the award is about and to encourage submissions for 2021. The look and feel will also determine the branding for the year.</p>

  <p>The art team landed on the idea of concentric circles. Not only it creates excitement in motion form, it also represents the idea of a ripple effect. Winning projects are celebrated through various channels, including a magazine feature. The recognition and exposure brings in more opportunities for the winners.</p>
<p>Since I’ve shown interest in exploring motion graphics, I was given the opportunity to create the video. The process allowed me to explore the possibilities with After Effects, and I’m really happy with the end product!
