	<p>Azure magazine runs a marketing campaign at the end of every year, offering a special price for gift subscriptions in time for the holiday. Along with the art department, I was tasked with refreshing the creative. In the pandemic year of 2020, we wanted to position our magazine subscription as the best social distanced gift. </p>

	<p>Focusing on the theme of giving & receiving, our team did a stop-motion to represent this “contactless” gift. The campaign tactics consisted of e-mail newsletters, web ads, blog post and social media assets. The campaign successfully increased gift subscription sales YoY, and a similar creative was used for the following year.</p>
