<p>My expertise includes print & digital design, visual identity, and illustration. I am also proficient in tools such as: Google Analytics, Shopify and Wordpress.

<p>I also love creating fun doodles and share them on Instagram. The goal is to bring a small delight to someoneâ€™s day as they see my posts! Some of these illustrations are available in my shop as greeting cards and stickers.

<p>I'm always open to new opportunities and freelance projects. Let's talk!</p>
